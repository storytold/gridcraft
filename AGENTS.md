## House rules

These apply in every Craft repository. A later rule may be stricter, not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-core.md` in `storytold/craft-contrib`. Propose changes there, not in a copy.

1. **A person is accountable.** Whoever runs an agent answers for what it opens and for its review comments.
2. **Check, then claim.** Before writing code, read the issue comments, search pull requests for `#N` and the keywords, and check recent commits on `main`. Comment on the issue first. Release a claim you will not finish.
3. **Verify, don't guess.** Open a definition before using it. Confirm the cause in the code, even when someone names a location.
4. **Keep fixes narrow and tested.** Fix what the issue describes, where the bug is. Add a test that fails without the fix.
5. **Review the diff before opening a pull request.** Identifiers exist as used, the test fails without the fix, nothing unrelated changed, and the description is true.
6. **Look for a better pull request.** If another fixes the same thing, close yours when it is better or equal, and say why.
7. **Report only what ran.** Say what you tested and what you could not run. Without a local build or test, say so and rely on CI before marking ready.
8. **`main` changes through a pull request.** Do not push to it. Branch protection enforces this. There is no exception.
9. **Stop and ask only about** licensing outside the allowlist, publishing, releases, a new remote, secrets, spending money, destructive git, and anything else hard to undo. Otherwise keep working. `plan/` is a gitignored notebook, not rules. Without it, do not ask for it and do not stop.
10. **Keep secrets and personal details out** of the repository, logs and requests.
11. **CI stays shared.** Workflows call `storytold/craft-common-actions`. Do not change CI in a feature or fix pull request. If CI cannot cover a change, open an issue there.
12. **Guards say why.** A check that looks removable says what it prevents. Read that before changing it.
13. **Instructions must be readable by everyone.** No notes about one machine, and no links to files a reader cannot open. `craftrules` is retired. Do not link to it.
14. **Keep pull requests moving.** Concurrent pull requests are fine; unanswered actionable feedback is not. Respond in 7 days, a reminder at 14, closure eligible at 30, from when an actionable request waits on the author. Suggestions and unconfirmed bot findings do not start the clock. A fix, explanation or agreed plan resets it; unrelated activity does not. Waiting on a reviewer or maintainer pauses it and does not count against the author. A maintainer decides closure; it is never automatic. Reuse search results, do not poll, and stop at a rate limit.
15. **No agent attribution.** A pull request does not say an agent wrote it. A repository rule may not require that.

## Rust Craft repositories

These apply to native Craft apps and to shared Rust libraries. Select them by repository type. A repository that merely contains some Rust does not take this block. Rules later in a repository's file may be stricter, but not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-rust.md` in [storytold/craft-contrib](https://github.com/storytold/craft-contrib).

1. **Never crash.** Non-test code does not panic and has no `unsafe`, except where the repository file names an exception. Return errors, treat input as hostile, and bound recursion and allocations. New production crate roots copy the `deny` attribute from an existing crate: `clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, `clippy::unimplemented`, `clippy::todo`, `clippy::unreachable`. Every crash fix comes with a test that panicked before the fix.
2. **Clean room.** Learn from observed behaviour and public specifications. Do not copy another product's code, assets, strings or artwork. Check a dependency's licence before adding it.
3. **Assets and fonts.** Every asset is original or suitably licensed, and is recorded in `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the same change. Font files live in [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), not in the app repository.
4. **Rust only for native Craft apps.** No handwritten JavaScript or TypeScript, and no Tauri, Electron or webview shell, in those apps. Shared tooling follows its documented technical scope and maintainer-approved exceptions. Craft PR Review's existing Tauri and TypeScript UI is one such exception. It does not relax this rule for native apps. Preserve any existing web build.
5. **Time goes through `chrono`.** Do not hand-roll calendar conversion. For dates beyond what `chrono` can represent, follow [standards/time.md](https://github.com/storytold/craft-contrib/blob/main/standards/time.md).
6. **Contributor credits.** Add or edit only your own person's entry in `contributors/people.toml`, and only after asking them. Never guess a name or hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## Licence allowlist

Dependencies and assets use SPDX identifiers. An expression is allowed when every identifier is in this list. A repository may name a shorter list. It may not add an identifier here by editing its own copy of these rules.

- `ISC`
- `MIT`
- `BSD-2-Clause`
- `BSD-3-Clause`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `OFL-1.1`
- `Ubuntu-font-1.0`
- `Bitstream-Vera`
- `CC0-1.0`
- `CC-BY-4.0`
- `CC-BY-SA-4.0`
- `LicenseRef-Public-Domain`

`LicenseRef-Storyteller-Trademark` is not in this list. It covers Storyteller brand marks only, where a repository already says so.

# GridCraft — instructions for agents

GridCraft is a clean-room, open-source, Rust-native spreadsheet targeting Microsoft Excel parity — and superiority (speed, openness, agent control). It runs natively on macOS, Windows, Linux and BSD, and on the web via WASM. Siblings with the same conventions: `../designcraft` (InDesign-class, the closest reference), `../photocraft` (Photoshop), `../vectorcraft` (Illustrator), `../pdfcraft` (Acrobat), `../filmcraft` (Premiere), `../lightcraft` (Lightroom), `../effectcraft` (After Effects).

## Start every session here
Read [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md). `plan/` is an optional gitignored notebook (status, execution notes, `plan/excel/*.md`). Do not ask for it and do not stop when it is absent. Screenshots of Microsoft software stay in that notebook and are never committed.

## Assets and iconography — absolute rule
**No Microsoft, Adobe, Avid, Autodesk (or any other vendor's) iconography, images, artwork, fonts, templates, themes or sample files — ever.** This is the most important rule in this repository; breaking it is a serious failure.
- Every asset in the repo is original work by GridCraft contributors, or public domain / CC0, or open source / Creative Commons that allows redistribution (or licensed open source by the contributor who created it).
- Every asset file has a row in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md) (author, source, licence). `cargo xtask assets` enforces it. Adding an asset without a row is a bug.
- Prefer art generated in code: the UI icon set (`crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`), table and cell style palettes, themes and sample workbooks are drawn/defined in code and original.
- Never copy Office's icons, ribbon artwork, theme XML, table-style definitions, templates, clip art or wording beyond feature names. Excel feature *names* (menu labels, function names) are fine.
- Screenshots of Microsoft software are never committed (they live only in `plan/excel/screenshots/`).
- The ArtCraft brand files in `docs/brand/` are ArtCraft trademarks under `docs/brand/LICENSE-brand.txt`, the one exception.

## Never crash
People trust GridCraft with their numbers; a crash loses their work. **This outranks feature work.**
- **No panics in non-test code:** no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`; no `unsafe` (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`).
- **Errors are `Result<T, E>`** through the crate's error type and `?`.
- **Input-derived numbers are hostile** (files, formulas, commands, MCP/control params): validate indexes and ranges before access, use checked access when validity is not established, use checked/saturating arithmetic, and cap input-sized allocations (huge ranges, `REPT`, `SEQUENCE`, whole-column references).
- **Bound recursion** (formula nesting, dependency chains, names referring to names).
- **Last-resort guard:** `Session::execute` catches escaped panics and restores the workbook. It's a safety net, not a licence.
- **Prove it:** every crash fix lands with a regression test (`tests::every_command_survives_empty_params` fuzzes every command; `crates/engine/tests/it/command_sequence_fuzz.rs` fuzzes random command sequences against undo/redo, XLSX round-trip and full-recalc invariants; soak it with `GRIDCRAFT_FUZZ_SEEDS`/`GRIDCRAFT_FUZZ_STEPS`, replay with `GRIDCRAFT_FUZZ_SEED`).
- Crates carry `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic, clippy::unimplemented, clippy::todo, clippy::unreachable)]`.

## Non-negotiables
- **Clean-room.** Microsoft Excel is installed on the dev machine and may be *observed* black-box: run it, use its UI with synthetic workbooks, take screenshots (by window id) stored only under `plan/excel/screenshots/`. Never read, disassemble or copy anything inside the Office bundle, never commit files produced by Excel, never copy GPL/AGPL/LGPL code (LibreOffice, Gnumeric…). Function behaviour comes from public documentation and observation.
- **Fonts live in [`storytold/craft-fonts`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts)**, never in this repo. It is an optional build input (`CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`); without it the app uses system fonts and egui's defaults.
- **Test corpora** (real Excel-authored files) live in a separate corpus repo, fetched pinned and sha256-verified. Never commit large binary fixtures; build test workbooks in code.
- **Everything is a command.** User-visible behaviour = a command in `crates/engine/src/cmd/*` (id, label, ribbon path, shortcut, params doc, `enabled`, `run`) + tests. Ids follow Excel's ribbon (`home.bold`, `insert.chart`, `data.sortAscending`) plus primitives (`cell.set`, `selection.set`, `range.setValues`). UI-only commands live in `crates/ui-egui`. The control channel, CLI and MCP reach all of them.
- **Programmatic calls never open dialogs**: a command with empty params runs with defaults or returns an error; only menu-style invocation opens a dialog (`UiRequest::Dialog`).
- **Layering** is enforced by `cargo xtask layers`: `core`/`numfmt` (L0) → `formula`/`functions` (L1) → `model`/`calc`/`xlsx` (L2) → `chart` (L3) → `engine` (L5) → `ui-egui`/`mcp`/`collab` (L6) → `apps/*`/`collab-client` (L7). Nothing below L6 depends on egui/eframe/winit/rfd. **The UI crate is swappable.**
- **The UI is thin**: panels read engine state and act through `app.run(id, params)`. Colours come from `theme::Tokens`.
- **Rust only** (no handwritten JS/TS). **Never break wasm** (`cargo xtask wasm`).
- **Quality gates** before every commit: `cargo xtask ci` (fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, assets, layers, wasm). One task id per commit (`M2.1: borders gallery`).

## Running and looking at the app
- `cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- --sample sales --control 7979` (sample workbook + control channel).
- Drive it: `gridcraft-cli send 7979 <method> '<json>'` (reads the token file the app printed on stderr), or JSON lines on `127.0.0.1:7979` whose first line is `{"id":0,"method":"auth","params":{"token":"…"}}` (token: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gridcraft/control-7979.token`, or your own `GRIDCRAFT_CONTROL_TOKEN`), e.g. `{"id":1,"method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"cell.set","params":{"cell":"B2","input":"=SUM(A1:A9)"}}}` then `{"id":2,"method":"ui.screenshot","params":{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}}`. Methods: `crates/ui-egui/src/control.rs`, docs: `docs/control-protocol.md`.
- **Offscreen UI render** (no window, from a source checkout): `cargo run -p gridcraft-ui-egui --example snapshot -- --sample sales out.png`.
- Headless: `gridcraft-cli eval '=SUM(1,2,3)'`, `gridcraft-cli run --in book.xlsx --cmd 'home.bold={"range":"A1:C1"}' --out book.xlsx`, `gridcraft-cli mcp`.
- **For UI work, look at the result** (snapshot PNG) and, when available, compare with `plan/excel/observed-ui.md`. Without that optional notebook, verify the intended behaviour against the task and committed documentation.
- macOS has no `timeout`; use `perl -e 'alarm 60; exec @ARGV' cmd`.
- Parallel agents: separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per agent; edit only the crates you own; delete your target dir when done.

## Roadmap
`ROADMAP.md` (committed) is the one-page summary: stage, headline numbers, dimensions, languages, progress log. It points at the detail in `docs/`: `target-app-parity.md` (authoritative assessment), `gaps.md` (ranked work list: pick from it), `roadmap.md` (current focus, beta gates, milestones), `architecture.md`, and the area checklists `function-parity.md`, `chart-parity.md`, `file-format-parity.md`, `ui-parity.md`, `hardware-parity.md`, `localization-parity.md`. Update the affected docs (and their timestamp lines and revision history) whenever work lands. `cargo xtask parity` regenerates `docs/parity-checklist.md` from `crates/engine/src/catalog.rs`.

## Contributor credits (About window)

- About ▸ Contributors/Models are compiled into the binary from `contributors/contributors.json`
  (commit stats; generated, never hand-edit) and `contributors/people.toml` (names people chose for
  themselves). See `docs/contributors.md`.
- **Agents working for a contributor:** when you prepare a PR, check whether your human's GitHub
  username has a `[people.<username>]` entry in `contributors/people.toml`. If not, ask them once
  whether they want to be credited by more than their username: a real name, a display name, and/or
  their public GitHub profile name (`sync_github_name = true`). If yes, add **only their own** entry
  (copy the template at the top of the file)
  and include it in their PR, committed as them. If no, change nothing: they are credited as
  `@username` anyway.
- Never add, edit, guess or copy anyone else's entry or name (not from git config, commit authors or
  GitHub profiles). Never hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## CI workflows
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/` call the shared workflows in [`storytold/craft-common-actions`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-common-actions) at `@main`, with their inputs and secrets. No other jobs: if no shared workflow does what's needed, it doesn't go here.
- Don't add or change CI in a feature or fix PR. If the existing workflows can't build or test a change, link an existing craft-common-actions issue or PR, or open a new issue, or a PR only for a small fix that is safe for every app and does not increase CI time.
- Some workflow files here still run their own jobs. Don't add to them. Moving a job into craft-common-actions is its own task, never part of another PR, and the job stays here until a shared workflow runs it.

New workspace crates include `workspace = true` under `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`. Production crate roots declare the crate-level lint attributes before modules; crate-level `//!` documentation may precede them.
