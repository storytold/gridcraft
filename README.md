## Why GridCraft

- **Familiar.** Excel's ribbon, formula bar, Name Box, sheet tabs, keyboard shortcuts, fill
  handle, point-mode formula entry with coloured references, Format Cells, Paste Special,
  conditional formatting, tables, charts and more. If you know Excel, you already know GridCraft.
- **Compatible.** XLSX is the native format: styles, themes, formulas (including dynamic arrays),
  tables, conditional formats, validation, comments, hyperlinks, charts, pictures, sparklines,
  PivotTables and print settings round-trip. CSV and TSV too.
  [XLSB worksheet data can be imported](docs/xlsb-import.md), using saved values instead of formulas.
  [ODS worksheet data can be imported](docs/ods-import.md), using saved values instead of formulas.
- **Capable.** A dependency-graph calculation engine with dynamic arrays and spilling,
  500+ worksheet functions plus LET, LAMBDA, MAP, REDUCE, SCAN, BYROW, BYCOL and MAKEARRAY,
  structured table references, Excel's full number-format language, sort and AutoFilter,
  Flash Fill, data validation, outlining and subtotals.
- **Fast.** Copy-on-write workbooks (undo snapshots are nearly free), incremental recalculation,
  and a virtualised grid that only lays out what's on screen.
- **Agent-native.** Every ribbon button, menu item, dialog, keystroke and mouse gesture is a
  command that agents can run over a JSON control channel, an **MCP server**, or the CLI.
- **Everywhere.** One Rust codebase for desktop and the web. No subscription, no licence server,
  no telemetry.

## Quick start

```sh
cargo run --release -p gridcraft                              # desktop app
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- --sample sales            # open a sample (sales, budget, grades)
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- book.xlsx                 # open a workbook
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- --sample sales --control 7979   # + JSON control channel
cargo xtask ci                                                 # fmt, clippy, tests, assets, layering, wasm
```

### Web

```sh
cd apps/gridcraft-web && trunk build --release     # → dist/web (serve it with any static server)
cd apps/gridcraft-web && trunk serve --release     # http://127.0.0.1:8771  (?sample=sales opens a sample)
```

You need [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Open uses the
browser's file picker (dropping files works too) and Save downloads the workbook.

### Ribbon access keys

Press and release **left Alt** on Windows/Linux/BSD, or press **F10** on any platform,
then type a sequence below one key at a time. Keytips appear on the supported Home
controls and menu items. On macOS, use F10 (Fn+F10 if required by your keyboard); Option
remains available for entering accented characters.

| Sequence after Alt/F10 | Action |
|---|---|
| `H A L` / `H A C` / `H A R` | Align left / center / right |
| `H V S` or legacy `E S` | Open Paste Special |
| `H O I` or legacy `O C A` | AutoFit selected columns |

In Paste Special, **T/V/F/C** select formats/values/formulas/comments, and **E** toggles
Transpose. **Enter** applies the selected options; **Escape** cancels the dialog.
These letters also work with Alt held on Windows/Linux/BSD.

Escape backs out one keytip level; Alt/F10 again exits keytips. Clicking, scrolling,
or switching windows cancels navigation. Access keys do not start while editing text
or using another dialog. This is initial support for these Home and legacy paths;
other ribbon commands and full mouse-free navigation remain to be implemented.
Browsers or desktop environments may reserve Alt/F10 for their own menus.

### Logs

The desktop app writes its log to standard error and to `gridcraft.log` in the `logs` folder
next to its settings: `~/.config/gridcraft/logs` on Linux and BSD (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gridcraft/logs`
when set), `~/Library/Application Support/GridCraft/logs` on macOS and
`%APPDATA%\GridCraft\logs` on Windows. Each start moves the previous log to `gridcraft.1.log` and
that one to `gridcraft.2.log`, so the log of a run that crashed survives the next start; attach
them to a bug report. A log file stops growing at 16 MiB. By default GridCraft's own crates log
at `info` and everything else at `warn`; `RUST_LOG` replaces that with env_logger-style
directives, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug` or `RUST_LOG=warn,gridcraft_engine=debug` (a trailing `*`
matches a prefix: `gridcraft*=debug`). Runs with `GRIDCRAFT_NO_PREFS` set (no saved settings)
log to standard error only.

## For agents: MCP, CLI and the control channel

```sh
claude mcp add gridcraft -- gridcraft-cli mcp                 # headless MCP server
gridcraft-cli mcp --connect 7979                               # MCP bridged to a running window
gridcraft-cli eval '=XLOOKUP("b",{"a","b"},{1,2})'             # → 2
gridcraft-cli run --sample budget --cmd 'home.bold={"range":"B4:F4"}' --out budget.xlsx
gridcraft-cli cat budget.xlsx --range B4:F15                   # aligned text table
gridcraft-cli commands --search chart                          # every command and its params
```

The MCP server offers tools such as `read_range`, `write_range`, `set_cell`, `evaluate_formula`,
`format_range`, `insert_chart`, `create_table`, `sort_range`, `filter` and `execute_command`
(which reaches every one of GridCraft's commands). The desktop app's control channel adds real
pointer and keyboard input, dialogs and screenshots. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md),
[`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) and [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Architecture

GridCraft is an engine-first Cargo workspace with enforced layering (`cargo xtask layers`). The
egui frontend is a separate crate, so the UI can be swapped without touching the engine.

| Layer | Crates |
|---|---|
| L0 | `core` (addresses, values, errors, dates, input parsing) · `numfmt` (number format codes) |
| L1 | `formula` (lexer, parser, printer, reference adjustment) · `functions` (worksheet function library) |
| L2 | `model` (workbook, sheets, copy-on-write cells, styles, tables, charts…) · `calc` (dependency graph, evaluator, dynamic arrays) · `xlsx` (XLSX, CSV, plus XLSB and ODS data import) |
| L3 | `chart` (toolkit-free chart layout and rendering) |
| L5 | `engine` (session, commands, history, clipboard, fill, sort, filter, file I/O) |
| L6 | `ui-egui` (Excel-style UI, control channel) · `mcp` (MCP server) |
| L7 | `apps/gridcraft`, `apps/gridcraft-cli`, `apps/gridcraft-web` |

- **Contributor and agent rules** (clean-room, asset policy, never-crash, quality gates): [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- **Bundled assets:** each one is listed with its licence in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md)
- **Releases:** signed macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD and web builds; see [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md)

## Roadmap

GridCraft is in **alpha**: the core workflow works end to end, but depth, fidelity and file
compatibility are still rough. It covers 89% of the Excel ribbon commands in our catalog
([`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md)) and 501 of Excel's 523 worksheet functions
([`docs/function-parity.md`](docs/function-parity.md)); weighted by what Excel users rely on, we
estimate it is about 50% ready for real work. Next up: XLSX fidelity on real-world files, very large
workbooks and multi-threaded recalc, chart depth, text in every script, and `.xls` import. Stage,
numbers and estimates are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); the ranked work list is [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md).

## Downloads

**Download GridCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `gridcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed. The MSI installer offers an optional desktop shortcut
(unchecked on a new installation).

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\gridcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

### macOS
