## Why GridCraft

- **Familiar.** Excel's ribbon, formula bar, Name Box, sheet tabs, keyboard shortcuts, fill
  handle, point-mode formula entry with coloured references, Format Cells, Paste Special,
  conditional formatting, tables, charts and more. If you know Excel, you already know GridCraft.
- **Compatible.** XLSX is the native format: styles, themes, formulas (including dynamic arrays),
  tables, conditional formats, validation, comments, hyperlinks, charts, pictures, sparklines,
  PivotTables and print settings round-trip. CSV and TSV too.
- **Capable.** A dependency-graph calculation engine with dynamic arrays and spilling,
  500+ worksheet functions plus LET, LAMBDA, MAP, REDUCE, SCAN, BYROW, BYCOL and MAKEARRAY,
  structured table references, Excel's full number-format language, sort and AutoFilter,
  Flash Fill, data validation, outlining and subtotals.
- **Fast.** Copy-on-write workbooks (undo snapshots are nearly free), incremental recalculation,
  and a virtualised grid that only lays out what's on screen.
- **Agent-native.** Every ribbon button, menu item, dialog, keystroke and mouse gesture is a
  command that agents can run over a JSON control channel, an **MCP server**, or the CLI.
- **Everywhere.** One Rust codebase for desktop and the web. No subscription, no licence server,
  no telemetry.

## Quick start

```sh
cargo run --release -p gridcraft                              # desktop app
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- --sample sales            # open a sample (sales, budget, grades)
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- book.xlsx                 # open a workbook
cargo run --release -p gridcraft -- --sample sales --control 7979   # + JSON control channel
cargo xtask ci                                                 # fmt, clippy, tests, assets, layering, wasm
```

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/gridcraft/releases) has ready-made builds, on Linux as
an AppImage, a `.deb`, an `.rpm` and a tarball. On Gentoo, the community [::snakebyte
overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the Linux release as
`app-office/gridcraft-bin` (not maintained by the GridCraft team):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-office/gridcraft-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/gridcraft
emerge --ask app-office/gridcraft-bin
```

### Web

```sh
cd apps/gridcraft-web && trunk build --release     # → dist/web (serve it with any static server)
cd apps/gridcraft-web && trunk serve --release     # http://127.0.0.1:8771  (?sample=sales opens a sample)
```

You need [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Open uses the
browser's file picker (dropping files works too) and Save downloads the workbook.

## For agents: MCP, CLI and the control channel

```sh
claude mcp add gridcraft -- gridcraft-cli mcp                 # headless MCP server
gridcraft-cli mcp --connect 7979                               # MCP bridged to a running window
gridcraft-cli eval '=XLOOKUP("b",{"a","b"},{1,2})'             # → 2
gridcraft-cli run --sample budget --cmd 'home.bold={"range":"B4:F4"}' --out budget.xlsx
gridcraft-cli cat budget.xlsx --range B4:F15                   # aligned text table
gridcraft-cli commands --search chart                          # every command and its params
```

The MCP server offers tools such as `read_range`, `write_range`, `set_cell`, `evaluate_formula`,
`format_range`, `insert_chart`, `create_table`, `sort_range`, `filter` and `execute_command`
(which reaches every one of GridCraft's commands). The desktop app's control channel adds real
pointer and keyboard input, dialogs and screenshots. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md),
[`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) and [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Architecture

GridCraft is an engine-first Cargo workspace with enforced layering (`cargo xtask layers`). The
egui frontend is a separate crate, so the UI can be swapped without touching the engine.

| Layer | Crates |
|---|---|
| L0 | `core` (addresses, values, errors, dates, input parsing) · `numfmt` (number format codes) |
| L1 | `formula` (lexer, parser, printer, reference adjustment) · `functions` (worksheet function library) |
| L2 | `model` (workbook, sheets, copy-on-write cells, styles, tables, charts…) · `calc` (dependency graph, evaluator, dynamic arrays) · `xlsx` (XLSX and CSV) |
| L3 | `chart` (toolkit-free chart layout and rendering) |
| L5 | `engine` (session, commands, history, clipboard, fill, sort, filter, file I/O) |
| L6 | `ui-egui` (Excel-style UI, control channel) · `mcp` (MCP server) |
| L7 | `apps/gridcraft`, `apps/gridcraft-cli`, `apps/gridcraft-web` |

- **Contributor and agent rules** (clean-room, asset policy, never-crash, quality gates): [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- **Bundled assets:** each one is listed with its licence in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md)
- **Releases:** signed macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD and web builds; see [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md)

## Roadmap

GridCraft is pre-alpha and moving fast. It covers 89% of Excel's ribbon and menu commands
([`docs/parity.md`](docs/parity.md)) and about 93% of its worksheet functions; weighted by depth,
we estimate about 65% of what Excel power users rely on. We're roughly 80% of the way to a first
alpha. Next up: signed release builds, XLSX fidelity on real-world files, performance on very large
sheets, then slicers, Solver, chart trendlines and a true Page Layout view. The plan and estimates
are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## The Crafting Apps

GridCraft is one of the **Crafting Apps**: free, open-source creative tools from the
[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/) team, each written from scratch in Rust and each able to
stand on its own.
