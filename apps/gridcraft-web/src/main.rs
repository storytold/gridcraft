//! GridCraft in the browser.
//!
//! Runs the same [`gridcraft_ui_egui::SheetApp`] as the desktop app through eframe's web runner
//! (wgpu: WebGPU where available, WebGL2 otherwise). Build with `trunk build --release` from
//! this directory (output in `dist/web`).
//!
//! Differences from the desktop app: no TCP control channel; Open uses the browser file picker
//! (bytes arrive asynchronously through `Services::inbox`); Save downloads the file; dropped
//! files are read asynchronously.
//!
//! URL query flags: `?webgl` forces WebGL2; `?sample=sales|budget|grades` opens a sample;
//! `?host=parent` (inside an `<iframe>`) talks to a same-origin parent page instead: it sends the
//! workbook to open and stores what GridCraft saves (`host`), and `&author=` names the user for
//! notes and comments.
