//! File content GridCraft does not model, carried through unchanged so that saving a workbook
//! never silently drops it (XLSX pass-through: custom XML, external links, connections, query
//! tables, form controls, OLE objects, chart sheets, and the original XML of embedded charts).
//!
//! The data is opaque to everything except the file-format crate: the model only holds it, so a
//! sheet's kept content disappears with the sheet. It is not part of the JSON format.
