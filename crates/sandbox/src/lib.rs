//! A confined launcher for helper processes that run code GridCraft doesn't trust, such as a
//! workbook's Python cells.
//!
//! The parent builds a [`Policy`] (the paths the program may read, and the programs it may
//! execute), creates a [`Canary`], and spawns the command [`launch_command`] returns. That command
//! runs the application itself again with [`LAUNCH_FLAG`]; the application hands its arguments to
//! [`handle_args`] before anything else, and the launcher:
//!
//! 1. closes every descriptor besides standard input, output and error, and refuses if one stays
//!    open: the confinement doesn't revoke what is already open, and an app's system libraries leave
//!    files open that a child inherits;
//! 2. confines itself: on Linux with Landlock (read-only access to the policy's paths, execute
//!    access only to its programs, no writes) and seccomp (no new processes, no sockets, none of
//!    the calls that escape or inspect a sandbox); on macOS it runs itself again under
//!    `sandbox-exec` with a deny-by-default profile built from the same policy ([`CONFINED_FLAG`]);
//! 3. checks that the confinement holds: reading the canary, writing next to it, a TCP
//!    connection and starting a process must each be denied;
//! 4. only then replaces itself with the program.
//!
//! When any step fails, the program never runs: the launcher writes one line,
//! `gridcraft-sandbox: refused: <reason>`, to its standard error and exits with
//! [`REFUSED_EXIT_CODE`]. Other platforms (Windows, FreeBSD, the web) have no confinement here:
//! [`support`] says so and [`launch_command`] refuses, so callers show `#BLOCKED!`.
//!
//! The crate has no `unsafe` code: the system calls sit behind the `landlock`, `seccompiler` and
//! `nix` crates, and behind `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` on macOS.
