//! Pass-through of package content GridCraft does not model, so that open → edit → save keeps it.
//!
//! On read, the raw bytes of unmodelled parts are kept with their content type and their
//! relationship graph, per owner: the package root (custom document properties, ribbon
//! customisation, add-in task panes), the workbook (custom XML, links to external workbooks with
//! their `<externalReferences>`, data connections, XML maps) and each sheet (query tables, cells
//! mapped to XML elements, form controls, ActiveX controls, OLE objects, the sheet background and
//! printer settings, with the sheet's `<picture>`, `<oleObjects>` and `<controls>` XML, the `r:id`
//! of `<pageSetup>`, the legacy VML shapes those controls need and the pictures of the headers and
//! footers, `&G`, with their `<legacyDrawingHF>`). The workbook also keeps its
//! `<fileVersion>` and the calcFeatures extension, which Excel needs to trust the saved values.
//!
//! On write, kept parts get fresh part names where needed and new relationship ids; the `r:id`s in
//! kept XML are rewritten to match. Kept content is conservative:
//! - Anything whose relationship graph reaches a part GridCraft reads and rewrites (worksheets,
//!   drawings, charts, tables, PivotTables, comments, slicers…) is not kept: it would point at
//!   content that no longer exists in the same form.
//! - External relationship targets (the path of a linked workbook) are kept as text and never
//!   opened, followed or refreshed. A relative path to a linked workbook is rewritten when the
//!   workbook is saved into another folder ([`rebase_links`]), so it still names the same file.
//! - Sheet content lives on the sheet: deleting the sheet drops it, Copy Sheet doesn't copy it.
//!   Cell references inside kept parts (a control's linked cell, a query table's range, a cell
//!   mapped to an XML element) are kept as they were, not adjusted to inserted or deleted rows.
//! - Strict Open XML files are not passed through (their namespaces differ from what we write).
//! - Sizes are bounded: per part and per workbook.
