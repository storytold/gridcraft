# Decisions

## Formula localization uses the existing interface preference

PR #98 builds on the persisted `UiState.language` introduced by #31 and extended by #104.
Español selects the Spanish function table and list/decimal separators; there is no competing
locale setting. Formula syntax without a supplied translation table falls back to English.
The editor translates to canonical English before engine commands, and translates back only
for display. API, clipboard and XLSX syntax remain stable. Existing names override aliases.

The revision is based directly on main after #31/#104 and Portuguese interface support (#82)
merged. Those locales retain their existing formula fallback; this change adds only Spanish.

## Preserve array evaluation when exporting formulas (#64)

GridCraft evaluates ordinary formulas with array semantics even when the final result occupies one cell. XLSX export marks actual spills and formulas whose results may differ under legacy implicit intersection as dynamic, using the spill range or a single-cell array reference. Legacy CSE array ranges keep their existing representation.

The exporter inspects the parsed formula without evaluating it. It distinguishes range-taking functions such as `SUM` from scalar arguments and operators: `SUM(A1:A3)` and `A1*2` stay ordinary, while `SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)` and `SQRT(A1:A3)` retain array evaluation. Legacy array-aware contexts such as `SUMPRODUCT` do not need an extra marker. Explicit `@` scalarizes its result without hiding array-sensitive operations inside it.

Names are resolved using workbook/sheet scope, and structured references distinguish one table-row cell from a column. Literal `INDIRECT` and `INDEX` arguments permit tighter classification; unresolved reference dimensions are conservatively treated as potentially multiple cells. Name/AST traversal is bounded, with array preservation as the fallback. This is an export classifier, not a claim of exact Excel metadata parity for every function or user-defined function. It stays within the format crate's existing dependencies and does not change calculation or import behavior.

This is a writer policy; interpreting implicit intersection in imported legacy formulas remains separate work. See Microsoft's [Formula vs. Formula2 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/excel/concepts/cells-and-ranges/range-formula-vs-formula2).

## Static cell pictures

Store immutable picture payloads in `Sheet::cell_pictures`, a sparse map keyed by `CellRef`,
shared through `Arc`. Ordinary cells keep their original size. Content replacement removes the
map entry; copy, fill, sort and structural edits explicitly transport it, and undo shares bytes.
Serialize the map as address/payload pairs so JSON does not require struct-valued object keys.
Keep the scalar `#VALUE!` fallback used by XLSX consumers that cannot interpret rich images.
This first implementation does not extend formula evaluation to rich values or implement
`IMAGE()`; references and text-only exports use the fallback.

Write picture value metadata and existing dynamic-array cell metadata into the same workbook
metadata part, with independent index tables. Resolve input parts through their relationships.
Support embedded PNG/JPEG files without fetching external resources. See
[cell pictures](cell-pictures.md) for the supported user workflow and current limits.

Picture metadata is optional during XLSX import: part-size limits, record limits and relationship
read errors produce warnings and retain scalar cell fallbacks. The generic package size limits
remain unchanged. Rebased on main before revision; ODS/XLSB import PRs are still unmerged, and
`Package::read_limited` uses the same implementation as the incoming XLSB PR #101 to avoid
duplicate helpers when that work lands.

The UI cache uses a 64 MiB texture budget with at most 4,096 sparse entries. Images used in the
current or preceding frame are protected from eviction. If the visible set exceeds the budget,
new images show the existing placeholder until capacity is available; header-based admission
avoids repeatedly decoding overflow images. More than 128 small visible pictures now keep stable
texture handles instead of cycling through the cache every frame.
