# Hosting GridCraft for the web

`gridcraft-web-<version>.zip` (from the GitHub release, or `packaging/web/package.sh`) holds a
static site in `gridcraft-web-<version>/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page. It loads everything through relative URLs. |
| `gridcraft-web-<hash>.js` | wasm-bindgen glue (generated, ES module) |
| `gridcraft-web-<hash>_bg.wasm` | The app (compresses to roughly a third with gzip/Brotli) |
| `_headers`, `.htaccess` | Sample header rules for Netlify/Cloudflare Pages and Apache |

There is no server-side code. Upload the folder's contents anywhere that serves static files.

## Any path works

All URLs in `index.html` are relative (`public_url = "./"` in `apps/gridcraft-web/Trunk.toml`),
so the site works at a domain root (`https://example.com/`), under a prefix
(`https://example.com/tools/gridcraft/`) and from a CDN bucket. The asset names carry a content
hash, so they can be cached forever. Only `index.html` needs revalidation.

## Required server settings

- **MIME type:** serve `.wasm` as `application/wasm`. Browsers refuse to stream-compile it under
  any other type, and the app then loads slowly or not at all. Serve `.js` as `text/javascript`.
  Most hosts already do both. For nginx, check that `mime.types` has `application/wasm wasm;`.
- **Compression:** turn on gzip or Brotli for `.wasm`, `.js` and `.html`. That cuts the
  download to roughly a third. You can also precompress (`brotli -k *.wasm`) and let
  the server send `Content-Encoding: br`.
- **Caching:** `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on the hashed `.wasm` and
  `.js` files, and `no-cache` on `index.html`.
- **HTTPS:** WebGPU (and the clipboard) only work in a secure context, which means `https://`
  or `http://localhost`. Over plain HTTP elsewhere, the app falls back to WebGL2.
- **No special isolation headers:** GridCraft doesn't use `SharedArrayBuffer`, so it doesn't
  need `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` or `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`. If your site already sends
  COEP `require-corp`, also send `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` (or `cross-origin`
  when the files live on a CDN) on the app's files.

nginx example:

```nginx
location /gridcraft/ {
    types { application/wasm wasm; text/javascript js; text/html html; }
    gzip on;
    gzip_types application/wasm text/javascript text/html;
    location ~* \.(wasm|js)$ { add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"; }
    location ~* index\.html$ { add_header Cache-Control "no-cache"; }
}
```

Local test: `python3 -m http.server 8765` inside the folder, then open http://localhost:8765/.

## Embedding in a page (iframe)

```html
<iframe
  src="https://example.com/gridcraft/"
  title="GridCraft spreadsheet"
  style="width: 100%; height: 720px; border: 0;"
  allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

- The app fills the iframe and follows its size, so size the iframe and not the app.
- Keyboard shortcuts go to the iframe after the user clicks into it, as with any embedded app.
- **Cross-origin embeds** work. Preferences are kept in the iframe's `localStorage`. Browsers
  that partition or block third-party storage may forget them between visits, and the app
  then starts with defaults.
- **Sandboxed iframes** need at least
  `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-downloads allow-popups"`. Without
  `allow-same-origin` there's no storage. Without `allow-downloads`, Save and Export (browser
  downloads) are blocked.
- Don't send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or a `frame-ancestors` CSP that excludes the embedding page.

## Renderer selection

GridCraft's web build is the same egui app as the desktop one, compiled to wasm
(`apps/gridcraft-web`). It renders with the backend `apps/gridcraft-web` selects (WebGPU
where available, otherwise WebGL2). If the web app adds URL flags to force a backend (as the
sibling Craft apps do with `?webgl` / `?cpu`), document them here; they also work on the
iframe `src`.

A browser with neither WebGPU nor WebGL2 gets a message in place of the app.

## Language and fonts

The interface language, the formula language and the regional format follow the browser
(`navigator.language`) until the user changes them in File › Options › Language; the choice is
kept in `localStorage` with the other preferences.

No CJK font is part of the bundle. When the interface language is Japanese, Korean or Chinese,
a cell holds CJK text, or a language list is open (it names 日本語, 中文, 한국어), the app fetches
one font file from `./fonts/` next to `index.html`:
`cjk-ja.ttf`, `cjk-ko.ttf`, `cjk-zh-CN.ttf` or `cjk-zh-TW.ttf`, matching the interface language;
in any other interface language, CJK text in cells uses `cjk-zh-CN.ttf`. Add the files you want
to support (any font with the matching glyph shapes, for example a subset of an open-licensed Noto
Sans CJK build) to the site and serve them with the same cache rules as the other assets. When a
file is missing, or the response is not a TrueType/OpenType font (some hosts answer a missing
file with their HTML page), the app logs a warning in the browser console and shows CJK characters
as boxes; every other language works without extra files.
